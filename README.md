# Case Study

As part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, I decided to forge my own path and create a case study of my own.

## Scenario

A Financial Technology (FinTech) company has been services mortgages and wants to streamline part of the process and ensure accuracy. By creating appraisal tools that automate the appraisal and valuation process meets a market demand for faster and more accurate appraisals. At the beginning of the process, the FinTech company wants to see data on the single family loan market. As a company, they already provide a suite of product solutions for the mortgage and housing industry. As they look to build virtual appraisal platform in hopes to streamline the appraisal process for refinances and housing market they decide the following questions will guide the process.

-How do the past 12-18 months of lending reflect the longer 3-5 trends in lending?
-What trends and market forces have shaped the single family loan market?
-The labor supply of appraisers is known to decline, and another team of analysts has already been tasked with market analysis and viability for the product.
## Data Preparation
Data was accessed from Freddie Mac, and includes monthly and quarterly data. We will create a dataframe that includes all the data from 2002 to Q2 of 2020 laid out on a monthly basis.
We will:
-Import the data
-Filter any data we do not need
-Remove null/NA values
-Reformat data types
-Create dataframe copies for feature engineering
-Export the dataframe to new CSV file
